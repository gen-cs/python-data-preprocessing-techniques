🚀 Data wrangling isn’t just cleaning — it’s engineering the future of your model.
This repository is my Python-powered preprocessing lab, where raw data transforms into machine-learning-ready gold.
🔍 What’s inside?
🛠 Feature Engineering – sculpting raw features into predictive assets.
🧩 Missing Value Magic – mean, median, mode, ffill, bfill — because NaNs don’t stand a chance.
⚖️ Imbalance Intervention – from upsampling to SMOTE, restoring fairness to your dataset.
📊 Outlier Surgery – detect with the 5-number summary, visualize with boxplots, and decide their fate.
🔄 Encoding Arsenal – One-Hot, Ordinal, Target-Guided — the right tool for every categorical beast.
💡 Every step blends concept explanation with real Python code + visualizations, so this isn’t just a tutorial — it’s a blueprint for production-ready preprocessing.
